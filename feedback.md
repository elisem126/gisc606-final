I lovedddd the worksheets from earth lab! If I ever got confused or needed to just slow down and process what we were doing I could always re read a section a million  times to get the picture of the challenge. I am saving earth lab forever! 
Nothing it was awesome! The labs actually felt like I would use it in real life and could go back if I didn't fully grasp something. 
It was great that you checked in, I think everyone really appericated it that. I didn't have a huge problem with getting the assignments done but knew others were struggling. Also the saturday at midnight due date helped alot too! 
Thanks so much Alex! We all loved your class and felt like we could actually use it in the real world!
