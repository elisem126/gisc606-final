i. I think my dream GIS job is working remote!!! and on anything related to the environment. I used to work for the Forest Service and really I would love a remote FS job mapping fires and timbersale! 
I really like looking at changes over time in GIS. So looking into creating maps with gifs to show the time lapse of things. I also really like coding however I do not feel super confident in it. So I would love to take some just online classes to help me keep getting familiar with coding.
I'd like to focus on cartography and making my maps look better through colors and having better editing skills to make a map look amazing! I'd just like to fine tune everything to do with GIS. Also camping and hike more, taking my saturday has been alittle WACK.
